## Umarema Phonology ##


#### Consonants ####

*Primary consonants of Umarema*

Umarema doesn't have an excessive amount of consonants, but isn't as bare-bones as a language like Japanese either. Most of its consonants come in voiced and voiceless pairs, with a notable exception being /s/, for which there is no equivalent /z/ sound in Umarema. It only has a single nasal, the /m/. Also unique, is that right now Umarema has three "r's": the trill, the German/French Uvular and the flap — only the first two are phonemes, however.

#### Vowels ####

*Basic Vowels of Umarema*

The vowels aren't super fixed yet, but most of them lean pretty closely to what they sound like on the IPA, a lot like most German vowels do.

Umarema also features devoiced vowels, which occasionally appear as allophones, similar to how they do in Japanese.
