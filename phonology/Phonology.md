## Umarema Phonology ##

![Consonants](https://github.com/LordSentox/umarema/blob/master/phonology/PNG/Umarema%20Consonants.png)
The consonants of Umarema.

Umarema doesn't have an excessive amount of consonants, but isn't as bare-bones as a language like Japanese either. Most of its consonants come in voiced and voiceless pairs, with a notable exception being /s/, for which there is no equivalent /z/ sound in Umarema. It only has a single nasal, the /m/. Also unique, is that right now Umarema has three "r's": the trill, the German/French Uvular and the flap â€” only two the first two are phonemes, however.
